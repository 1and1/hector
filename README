A high level cassandra java client.
Cassandra is a highly available column oriented database: http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/
Hector is the greatest warrior in the greek mithology, Troy's builder and brother of Cassandra

This client provides:

 o high level, simple object oriented interface to cassandra
 o failover behavior on the client side
 o connection pooling for improved performance and scalability
 o JMX conters for monitoring and management
 o load balancing

TODO:
 o Add more JMX stats, especially for read and write throughput management

The work was initially inspired by http://code.google.com/p/cassandra-java-client/ but has taken off to different directions since.
