This is a fork of the latest release of Hector (as of 8/10/2010) to work with Cassandra 0.7.  This should be considered an experimental version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A high level cassandra java client.
Cassandra is a highly available column oriented database: http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/
Hector is the greatest warrior in the greek mythology, Troy's builder and brother of Cassandra
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra


This client provides:

 o high level, simple object oriented interface to cassandra
 o failover behavior on the client side
 o connection pooling for improved performance and scalability
 o JMX conters for monitoring and management
 o load balancing

Detailed documentation of Hector features and usage can be found in PDF hosted by Riptano: http://www.riptano.com/sites/default/files/hector-v2-client-doc.pdf

The work was initially inspired by http://code.google.com/p/cassandra-java-client/ but has taken off to different directions since.
