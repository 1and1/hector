Hector uses *Sphinx* (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ 1.0.8) to generate and parse the docs
and it is based on the rST format (This page has the same format)

In order to be able to generate sphinx docs, please install Sphinx as indicated http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/sampledoc/getting_started.html

Hector docs live under the branch: **gh-pages**. So you need to do a checkout onto that branch:

   ``git checkout gh-pages``

Once there, ``cd source/content`` is where we keep the source files with the content. 

All you need to do is to find the right place to edit the file and create new ones.
Once it's done and if you want to check how it looks::

   cd <gh-pages base directory>
   make clean html

Point a browser to the index file in the same directory.
